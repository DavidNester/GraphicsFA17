\f0\fs24 \cf0 giving us the ability to do points and the other shapes that could be made with the given functions really made it possible to start being creative in this course. I now have a better idea of how OpenGL works and what some of its functions are. My interest was in making fractals out of the shapes that we could make. I made two different fairly simple ones. One was a Sierpinski Carpet which took a large square and made a square in the center of it and then repeated the process with the 8 squares surrounding the middle square. The other one that I made took a square and then built two squares on top of each square continuously.}
