\f0\fs24 \cf0 Mathematically generating points has lots of potential to make this class interesting. I did a little bit of messing around with a parabolic curve but I thought of lots of different cool things to do with plotting curves. I would like to work more with fractals and making them more complex than the simple geometric ones that I have been making. It would be interesting to try to make a calculator app that can take a function as input and then show a plot of it. }
