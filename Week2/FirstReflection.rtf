\f0\fs24 \cf0 The first thing that I see when examining the first programs (skeleton program and teapot program) is that much of graphics involves using the OpenGL library. All of the lines involve a command from the library. This suggests to me that in order to excel at this you must familiarize yourself with the various commands (based on the documentation that I scrolled through, there are a lot). Given my inexperience, I did not have a lot of success with changing or adding commands. I\'92m guessing that I will quickly pick up on things as we have more experience playing around with simple things. At the moment there is a lot going on. I noticed various other shapes that could be drawn in a different version of the teapot program that was given. Many of them have arguments that have to do with the size, position, and orientation of the shape that they produce. From my understanding of graphics, there will be a lot of things involving transformations of images which is generally done with linear algebra (multiplying by matrices). }
